## What is emdaer?

emdaer lets you to use plugins and transforms within markdown files because READMEs (and other documentation) are crucial files that are often lackluster and/or incomplete and have a tendency to become stale

A couple use cases that illustrate the power of emdaer:

- ü§ù **Keep things in sync**: Do you have a series of repositories that should have their READMEs kept in sync? With emdaer you can create a template that pulls all the information from each project's package.json and codebase
- üçã **Keep things fresh**: Do you want to thank your contributors in your README? With emdaer you can pull that information from GitHub automatically and have it organized in an attractive list or table
