module.exports = `## This README

This README was generated with emdaer. However, it is special in that it shares its content with the [emdaer website](emdaer.me) via the [@emdaer/meta](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emdaer/meta) and [@emdaer/plugin-node-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emdaer/plugin-node-package) packages. [@emdaer/meta](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emdaer/meta) exports each section of this README as a node module which  [@emdaer/plugin-node-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emdaer/plugin-node-package) imports like so:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
\`\`\`md
<!--emdaer-p
  - '@emdaer/plugin-node-package'
  - path: '@emdaer/meta/lib/README/this-readme.js'
-->
\`\`\`;`;
