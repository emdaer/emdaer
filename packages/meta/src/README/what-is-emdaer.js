module.exports = `## What is emdaer?

emdaer lets you to use plugins and transforms within markdown files because READMEs (and other documentation) are crucial files that are often lackluster and/or incomplete and have a tendency to become stale

A couple use cases that illustrate the power of emdaer:

- 🤝 **Keep it in sync** Create templates for use across all of your organizations projects to promote synchronicity and reduce doing the same work over and over
- 🗃 **Keep it organized** Keep your documentation DRY and organized by importing content from your codebase, splitting large documents into chunks, and formatting it with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
- 🍋 **Keep it fresh** Ensure your documents stay up to date by pulling in new data from various sources with every build`;
